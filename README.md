## Instalation
For using this program you need 2 dependencies installed on your computer:
1. pyserial - used for communication with the multimeter
2. pygame - used for the GUI

Please reffer to the documentation of those 2 libraries for installation.

## Using the program
Before launching, make sure that you have the right serial device selected. To change the device name, just eddit the `fluke_device` at the top of the main.py file.
```py
fluke_device = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
``` 

Before launching the program your multimeter __**must be turned on**__, otherwise the program will hang when it trys to read form the device. 

## Customizing
Feel free to fork this project and make your own variation of it. I know that my GUI is not the best, so feel free to change it and send me the updated look, I might include it in the original repository.
